Note that if the encoder time base is too coarse, then the keyframes may be forced on frames with timestamps lower than the specified time. The default encoder time base is the inverse of the output framerate but may be set otherwise via -enc_time_base.\n\nIf one of the times is \"chapters[delta]\", it is expanded into the time of the beginning of all chapters in the file, shifted by delta, expressed as a time in seconds. This option can be useful to ensure that a seek point is present at a chapter mark or any other designated place in the output file.\n\nFor example, to insert a key frame at 5 minutes, plus key frames 0.1 second before the beginning of every chapter:\n\n-force_key_frames 0:05:00,chapters-0.1\n\nexpr:expr\n\nIf the argument is prefixed with expr:, the string expr is interpreted like an expression and is evaluated for each frame. A key frame is forced in case the evaluation is non-zero.\n\nThe expression in expr can contain the following constants:\n\nn\n\nthe number of current processed frame, starting from 0\n\nn_forced\n\nthe number of forced frames\n\nprev_forced_n\n\nthe number of the previous forced frame, it is NAN when no keyframe was forced yet\n\nprev_forced_t\n\nthe time of the previous forced frame, it is NAN when no keyframe was forced yet\n\nt\n\nthe time of the current processed frame\n\nFor example to force a key frame every 5 seconds, you can specify:\n\n-force_key_frames expr:gte(t,n_forced*5)\n\nTo force a key frame 5 seconds after the time of the last forced one, starting from second 13:\n\n-force_key_frames expr:if(isnan(prev_forced_t),gte(t,13),gte(t,prev_forced_t+5))\n\nsource\n\nIf the argument is source, ffmpeg will force a key frame if the current frame being encoded is marked as a key frame in its source.\n\nsource_no_drop\n\nIf the argument is source_no_drop, ffmpeg will force a key frame if the current frame being encoded is marked as a key frame in its source. In cases where this particular source frame has to be dropped, enforce the next available frame to become a key frame instead.\n\nNote that forcing too many keyframes is very harmful for the lookahead algorithms of certain encoders: using fixed-GOP options or similar would be more efficient."

The output channel layout is guessed from the number of channels mapped (mono if one \"-map_channel\", stereo if two, etc.). Using \"-ac\" in combination of \"-map_channel\" makes the channel gain levels to be updated if input and output channel layouts don’t match (for instance two \"-map_channel\" options and \"-ac 6\").\n\nYou can also extract each channel of an input to specific outputs; the following command extracts two channels of the INPUT audio stream (file 0, stream 0) to the respective OUTPUT_CH0 and OUTPUT_CH1 outputs:\n\nffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT_CH0 -map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT_CH1\n\nThe following example splits the channels of a stereo input into two separate streams, which are put into the same output file:\n\nffmpeg -i stereo.wav -map 0:0 -map 0:0 -map_channel 0.0.0:0.0 -map_channel 0.0.1:0.1 -y out.ogg\n\nNote that currently each output stream can only contain channels from a single input stream; you can’t for example use \"-map_channel\" to pick multiple input audio channels contained in different streams (from the same or different files) and merge them into a single output stream. It is therefore not currently possible, for example, to turn two separate mono streams into a single stereo stream. However splitting a stereo stream into two single channel mono streams is possible.\n\nIf you need this feature, a possible workaround is to use the amerge filter. For example, if you need to merge a media (here input.mkv) with 2 mono audio streams into one single stereo channel audio stream (and keep the video stream), you can use the following command:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex \"[0:1] [0:2] amerge\" -c:a pcm_s16le -c:v copy output.mkv\n\nTo map the first two audio channels from the first input, and using the trailing ?, ignore the audio channel mapping if the first input is mono instead of stereo:\n\nffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.0 -map_channel 0.0.1?

For simple graphs – those with one input and one output of the same type – see the -filter options. filtergraph is a description of the filtergraph, as described in the “Filtergraph syntax” section of the ffmpeg-filters manual.\n\nInput link labels must refer to input streams using the [file_index:stream_specifier] syntax (i.e. the same as -map uses). If stream_specifier matches multiple streams, the first one will be used. An unlabeled input will be connected to the first unused input stream of the matching type.\n\nOutput link labels are referred to with -map. Unlabeled outputs are added to the first output file.\n\nNote that with this option it is possible to use only lavfi sources without normal input files.\n\nFor example, to overlay an image over video\n\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex '[0:v][1:v]overlay[out]' -map\n'[out]' out.mkv\n\nHere [0:v] refers to the first video stream in the first input file, which is linked to the first (main) input of the overlay filter. Similarly the first video stream in the second input is linked to the second (overlay) input of overlay.\n\nAssuming there is only one video stream in each input file, we can omit input labels, so the above is equivalent to\n\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay[out]' -map\n'[out]' out.mkv\n\nFurthermore we can omit the output label and the single output from the filter graph will be added to the output file automatically, so we can simply write\n\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay' out.mkv\n\nAs a special exception, you can use a bitmap subtitle stream as input: it will be converted into a video with the same size as the largest video in the file, or 720x576 if no video is present. Note that this is an experimental and temporary solution. It will be removed once libavfilter has proper support for subtitles.\n\nFor example, to hardcode subtitles on top of a DVB-T recording stored in MPEG-TS format, delaying the subtitles by 1 second:\n\nffmpeg -i input.ts -filter_complex \\\n  '[#0x2ef] setpts=PTS+1/TB [sub] ; [#0x2d0] [sub] overlay' \\\n  -sn -map '#0x2dc' output.mkv\n\n(0x2d0, 0x2dc and 0x2ef are the MPEG-TS PIDs of respectively the video, audio and subtitles streams; 0:0, 0:3 and 0:7 would have worked too)\n\nTo generate 5 seconds of pure red video using lavfi color source:\n\nffmpeg -filter_complex 'color=c=red' -t 5 out.mkv"
