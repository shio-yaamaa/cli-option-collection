The string consists of the specification characters a, e, m, o, and p. Multiple characteristics can be concatenated within the same string and multiple -p options can be specified. The meanings of the specification characters are as follows: a Do not preserve file access times. By default, file access times are preserved whenever possible. e “Preserve everything”, the user ID, group ID, file mode bits, file access time, and file modification time. This is intended to be used by root, someone with all the appropriate privileges, in order to preserve all aspects of the files as they are recorded in the archive. The e flag is the sum of the o and p flags. m Do not preserve file modification times. By default, file modification times are preserved whenever possible. o Preserve the user ID and group ID. p “Preserve” the file mode bits. This is intended to be used by a user with regular privileges who wants to preserve all aspects of the file other than the ownership. The file times are preserved by default, but two other flags are offered to disable this and use the time of extraction instead.\n\nIn the preceding list, ‘preserve’ indicates that an attribute stored in the archive is given to the extracted file, subject to the permissions of the invoking process. Otherwise the attribute of the extracted file is determined as part of the normal file creation action. If neither the e nor the o specification character is specified, or the user ID and group ID are not preserved for any reason, pax will not set the S_ISUID (setuid) and S_ISGID (setgid) bits of the file mode. If the preservation of any of these items fails for any reason, pax will write a diagnostic message to standard error. Failure to preserve these items will affect the final exit status, but will not cause the extracted file to be deleted. If the file characteristic letters in any of the string option-arguments are duplicated or conflict with each other, the one(s) given last will take precedence. For example, if -p eme is specified, file modification times are still preserved."

If only a from_date is supplied, all files with a modification or inode change time equal to or younger are selected. If only a to_date is supplied, all files with a modification or inode change time equal to or older will be selected. When the from_date is equal to the to_date, only files with a modification or inode change time of exactly that time will be selected.\n\nWhen pax is in write or copy mode, the optional trailing field [c][m] can be used to determine which file time (inode change, file modification or both) are used in the comparison. If neither is specified, the default is to use file modification time only. The m specifies the comparison of file modification time (the time when the file was last written). The c specifies the comparison of inode change time (the time when the file inode was last changed; e.g., a change of owner, group, mode, etc). When c and m are both specified, then the modification and inode change times are both compared.\n\nThe inode change time comparison is useful in selecting files whose attributes were recently changed or selecting files which were recently created and had their modification time reset to an older time (as what happens when a file is extracted from an archive and the modification time is preserved). Time comparisons using both file times is useful when pax is used to create a time based incremental archive (only files that were changed during a specified time range will be archived).\n\nA time range is made up of six different fields and each field must contain two digits. The format is:\n\n\n\n[[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]HH]MM[.SS]\n\nWhere cc is the first two digits of the year (the century), yy is the last two digits of the year, the first mm is the month (from 01 to 12), dd is the day of the month (from 01 to 31), HH is the hour of the day (from 00 to 23), MM is the minute (from 00 to 59), and SS is the seconds (from 00 to 59). The minute field MM is required, while the other fields are optional and must be added in the following order: HH, dd, mm, yy, cc.\n\nThe SS field may be added independently of the other fields. Time ranges are relative to the current time, so -T 1234/cm would select all files with a modification or inode change time of 12:34 PM today or later.
