This can be used as an alternative to log coloring, e.g. when dumping the log to file.\n\nFlags can also be used alone by adding a ’+’/’-’ prefix to set/reset a single flag without affecting other flags or changing loglevel. When setting both flags and loglevel, a ’+’ separator is expected between the last flags value and before loglevel.\n\nloglevel is a string or a number containing one of the following values:\n\n‘quiet, -8’\n\nShow nothing at all; be silent.\n\n‘panic, 0’\n\nOnly show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as an assertion failure.
