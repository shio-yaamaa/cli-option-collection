The old string may also contain newline characters. Any non-null character can be used as a delimiter (‘/’ is shown here). Multiple -s expressions can be specified. The expressions are applied in the order they are specified on the command line, terminating with the first successful substitution.\n\nThe optional trailing g continues to apply the substitution expression to the pathname substring, which starts with the first character following the end of the last successful substitution. The first unsuccessful substitution stops the operation of the g option. The optional trailing p will cause the final result of a successful substitution to be written to standard error in the following format:\n\noriginal-pathname >> new-pathname\n\nFile or archive member names that substitute to the empty string are not selected and will be skipped."
